The version aims to sort non-string type values. 

We convert the value(int/double type) into characters(range: -128 ~ 127) 
and insert it into the tree by iterating from the high byte to the low byte, 
which is different from string.
For those negtive bytes, we map them into branch: byte + 256

To get values in asceding order, we traverse the tire in preoder.
